				<img src="images/pitch/money.jpg" alt="$$$" class="left" />
				<p>During this period of rapid innovation and evolution within the global industry,
                people around the world look to GiaB as a successful example of a company that
                managed to grow and dynamically evolve to meet a market undergoing drastic
                transformations. Most of the time, we were at the forefront of this revolution
                because unlike many other companies, our ultimate interest has always been to hoard as much
                gold as possible in our massive underground vaults. We feel that is our responsibility
                as the custodians of this planet to preserve all the shiny minerals and protect them
                from human exploitation. Our noble values and clear missions allow us to react instantly
                to market changes without being encumbered by man-made social structures or ethical
                boundaries. At Ghost in a Bottle Zaibatsu, we transcend morality.™  
                </p>
                <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
                <p>
                Following the ice age and the fifth war, the world needed hope. People prayed for
                a savior to show them the way. The combined hopes, dreams, prayers, and the dark energy 
                inherent in the depths of the human soul, came together to give birth to purified energy
                in the form of a bottle.
                </p>
                <p>
                This was no ordinary bottle, however. It was a special bottle with a mysterious aura.
                The bottle contained the last hope of humanity; a baby ghost born of darkness has
                arrived to teach people how they can become whole again. The Ghost in a Bottle.
                </p>
                <p>
                Naturally, the Ghost in a Bottle graduated with honors and went on to start its own
                mega-corporation. The new conglomerate, the Ghost in a Bottle Company, soon experienced
                rapid expansion as it spread all over the globe and employed most of the civilized
                people in the world. Huge Arcologies were built to house the employees and help them
                focus on their ultimate purpose: making money for GiaB. 
                </p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
				<img src="images/pitch/digital.jpg" alt="Internets" class="right" />
				<p>
                It wasn't always easy, however. Many criminal elements and rogue organizations
                opposed the rightful ideals of GiaB. Some were jealous of Ghost in a Bottle,
                others wanted the gold for themselves, and a few thought that they were saving
                the world or its petty creatures. These maggots had to be eliminated to ensure
                the fulfillment  of GiaB's pure vision. We do realize that our approach to dealing
                with this issue might be unique, but our investment is empowering human
                capital and logistic resources to facilitate the efficient gathering of precious
                resources. That itself is the very definition of saving the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                This is an exciting time for Ghost in a Bottle and humanity as a whole. It is our
                sincere belief that we have all the elements of a successful revolution in place
                including premier talent, a strategic vision, and an uncompromising lust for
                gold, silver, and bitcoins. We look forward to working with you to take our
                corporation to the next level of growth and excellence of innovation.
                </p>
